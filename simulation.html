    <h2>01 Hash</h2>
    <p>
      A hash function (we use SHA-256) takes any input—text, numbers, even gigabytes of data—and
      produces a fixed-length “fingerprint.” This one-way, collision-resistant mapping is the foundation of
      blockchain immutability: even a single-bit change in the input yields a radically different output, and
      you can’t reverse it to recover the original.

      In the demo you can type or paste any message and instantly see its 64-character hash update; flip one character
      and watch the entire fingerprint “avalanche,” illustrating why hashes anchor data tamper-evidently.

<section id="block" data-sim-src="block_simulation.html" data-sim-title="Block Construction Simulator">
  <div class="text">
    <h2>02 Block</h2>
    <p>
      A block bundles together an index, a nonce, your data payload (e.g. transactions), the previous block’s hash,
      and its own resulting hash. This structure underpins proof-of-work: miners tweak the nonce until the hash meets
      a difficulty target (e.g. starts with “0000”), and chaining via the previous-hash links blocks into an immutable
      ledger.

      In the simulator you can edit any field to see the hash turn red (invalid), then click Mine to brute-force
      a new nonce until the hash field turns green, demonstrating how proof-of-work locks in block content.

  <div class="text">
    <h2>03 Chain</h2>
    <p>
      A blockchain is simply a sequence of blocks, each pointing to its predecessor via its hash.
      This chaining makes any tampering wildly expensive, since an attacker would have to re-mine every subsequent
      block faster than the rest of the network.

      The demo shows you a row of blocks you can edit: change block 3 and blocks 4–5 immediately turn red, forcing
      you to re-mine each in order to restore validity—perfectly illustrating why history is so hard to rewrite.

<section id="network" data-sim-src="network_simulation.html" data-sim-title="Network Propagation Simulator">
  <div class="text">
    <h2>04 Network</h2>
    <p>
      A blockchain network consists of independent peers (nodes), each holding its own copy of the chain and always
      adopting the longest valid version they know. This ensures consensus and resilience: even if some peers go
      offline or temporarily disagree, the network converges on a single history.

      In the interactive view you see multiple side-by-side chains; when Peer A mines ahead, Peer B automatically
      downloads and switches to the longer chain, showing how forks resolve and consensus emerges. SCROLL down to
      test how the blocks interact with each other and different peers.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="tokens" data-sim-src="token_simulation.html" data-sim-title="Tokens & Balance Simulator">
  <div class="text">
    <h2>05 Tokens</h2>
    <p>
      Tokens are simple “value, from → to” records—the state machine that tracks who owns what. Recording them on the
      chain makes the ledger auditable and tamper-evident: changing any transfer breaks the block’s hash and cascades
      invalidity downstream.

      The simulator embeds multiple token rows per block; tweaking any bogus transfer turns the hash red across all
      affected blocks, and you can re-mine to lock in a new, valid transaction history, demonstrating how blockchains
      enforce transparent, verifiable token transfers. SCROLL right and down to test how the blocks interact with each
      other and different peers.
